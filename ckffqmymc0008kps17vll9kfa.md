## My Story of Switching Careers to Become a Developer [Video]

So I did a thing last night. 

I made my first YouTube video! In it, I tell my story of how I went from training to be a pastor to ending up as a software engineer.

I hope you find some inspiration and insights for your own journey, wherever you might be. ✌️
